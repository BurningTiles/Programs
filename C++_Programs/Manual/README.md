# List of Programs.

```
~  1.1  WAP to print student's name, address, contact number.
```
```
~  2.1	WAP for whether the number is odd or even.    
~  2.2	WAP to make cakculator using switch case.
```
```
~  3.1	WAP to print Fibonacci series using function using for loop.
```
```
~  4.1	WAP to implement arithmetic operations using inline function.
```
```
~  5.1	WAP for function with default arguments.   
~  5.2	WAP to illustrate the concept of call by value and call by reference.
```
```
~  6.1	WAP to implement function overloading and returns area of square,
        rectangle, circle and triangle.
```
```
~  7.1	WAP to find the mean value of given numbers using friend function.
```
```
~  8.1	WAP to declare a class BOX with length, width and height parameters.
        Assign the values and print the values for two object1 and object2
        (Outside and inside the class definition).
```
```
~  9.1  Expand practical 8 and create an array of 4 objects B[4] to accept 
        and display to details of the box.
        (For array within class and array of objects concepts).
```
```
~ 10.1  WAP for creating constructor and destructor of class Date with 
        3 parameters dd,mm,yy. Initialize 2 objects D1, D2 with 12-02-2019 
        and 15-03-2019 values with parameterized constructor.
```
```
~ 11.1  WAP to implement concept of copy constructor.
```
```
~ 12.1  WAP to illustrate operator overloading. 
        (Using unary operator overloading).
```
```
~ 13.1  WAP to add variables of 2 objects using operator overloading.
        (Using binary operator overloading).
```
```
~ 14.1  WAP to demonstrate the use a pointer.
```
```
~ 15.1  WAP to demonstrate basic to class type conversion and class to basic
        type conversion.
```
```
~ 16.1  WAP to one class to another class type conversion.
```
```
~ 17.1  Consider a class network as shown in figure given below. The class 
        Employee derives information from both Account and Admin classes
        which in turn derives information from the class Person. Define all
        the four classes and write a program to create, update and display
        the information contained in Employee objects.

```
~ 18.1  Declare a class called item having data members item_code, item_name,
        cost and discount. Derive two classes from class item, namely
        employee and customer. The class employee has datamembers like
        employee_code, employee_name and amount. The class customer has
        datamembers like customer_name and amount. Define following functions
        for
        - initializing datamembers.
        - displaying the values of data members.
        - computing amount to be paid for apurchased item. Also define function
          main to create ovjects of both derived classes and to showusage of
          abouve functions.
```
```
~ 19.1  WAP to illustrate concept of Function Overriding.
