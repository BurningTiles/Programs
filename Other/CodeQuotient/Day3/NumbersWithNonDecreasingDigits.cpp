/*
Some numbers such as 7, 234, 12378 have the digits that are non-decreasing when we read them from left to right. In this problem, we want to find the largest such number less than or equal to a given number N.


Input Format
Integer N


Output Format
Largest integer M â‰¤ N that has its digits non-decreasing. The output should not contain leading zeros.


Constraints
N <= 10^18


Sample Input 1
89

Sample Output 1
89

Explanation
89 itself has non-decreasing digits.

Sample Input 2
549

Sample Output 2
499

Explanation
From 500 to 549, the integers have 5 as the leading digit and the
second digit must be less than or equal to 4. But then, such a 
number cannot have its digits non decreasing.
