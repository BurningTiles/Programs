# Sorting Algorithms.

In this program it contains two files. One is header file which contains all sorting functions. Second is cpp file which will be compiled and executed.

Main reason behind creating header file is to hide all the complexity of functions and make program look small and better. Which also helps in understanding and managing program.

If there is any mistake in program please report it.

Thanks...
